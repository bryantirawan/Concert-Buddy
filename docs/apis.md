## API 

Setlist fm has good documentation here: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html as well as an interactive environment to visualize JSON body responses you will get with different querys and parameters here: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/ui/index.html 

Specifically, we will be using the query: search/setlists with cityName parameter. This will generate a list of concerts (setlist fm refers to concerts as setlists) for a location. The concerts are user-generated as setlist.fm is a wiki-style site and typically, concerts are only added for the next 2 or 3 days. This is why we are forced to market our app as a "last-minute" concert buddy service and "last-minute" ticket purchasing service. We figure that is ok as most people who are looking for a random concert buddy are using this app because a friend cancelled on them last-minute.
