## Find a Buddy / Sell Tickets page

Find a buddy and sell tickets both utilize a search feature that searches for concerts based on city name or artist name.
There is a toggle feature to switch between the two search options. Once a search is submitted, a table will populate containing
all of the concerts taking place within the next few days that match the search criteria. Buttons to attend the concert and sell
tickets are available for each concert.
