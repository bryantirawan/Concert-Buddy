Today, I worked on:
* updating the SellerPersonalTicket.js page to fix bugs (i.e. making try except cases when there are no tickets that exist). I also worked on creating a PUT request to update the Ticket to allow for the seller to toggle sold = False.

Today, I worked on:
* finished the SellerPersonalTicket.js page. Changed sold tickets to come from the orderitem model instead of ticket model. Also added a date filter. Also created a new view for changing tickets.
