Thanks for your feedback!
So far, 3rd party API will be setlist.fm which I have experience with and has good documentation. We plan on using search/setlists with the query parameters: city and dates. We also plan on using an e-commerce CMS built for Django called Wagtail to build the ticket purchasing side.
We plan on having two microservices (ticket purchasing and concert buddy matching). The concert buddy matching will of course need registered users. The sellers of tickets will also need registering, but buying users can skip registration.

This response would be a good thing to put in your documentation.
I mean to say, I see a basic bit of this information here, but this is the appropriate amount of detail that should be in your documentation.

From Slack:

GM!  Very ambitious concept.  I'm eager to see the end product and would like the group to reconsider or re-label some of the concepts as 'stretch' functionality. 
- Pls try to identify any 3rd party API's you plan to use as soon as possible.  
- Pls consider non-registered-user functionality, if applicable  
- fyi, check out the DICE app - very similar features
